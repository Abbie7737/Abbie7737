- 👋 Hi, I’m @Abbie7737
- 👀 I’m interested in creating completely local LLM solutions that meet my software automation needs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning modified 'Vibe' coding - The creative process is all mine but the coding is heavily prompted Claude Code. So far this has worked well with a learning curve. This workflow saves me time and I get exactly the tools and applications I need.
